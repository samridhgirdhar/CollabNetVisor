# OSS Project Governance Toolkit

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive network analysis of your project's collaboration patterns, these are the top recommended strategies for enhancing project governance:

1. **Growth Strategies**: Convert peripheral contributors to regular contributors - Your network has a large periphery of occasional contributors that could become more engaged.

2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Reduce bus factor risk - Your project shows high dependence on a small number of key contributors, creating risk if these individuals become unavailable.

3. **Decision Making**: Improve cross-community decision coordination - Your project has communities with limited external connections, which can lead to misaligned decisions and duplicated work.

## Growth Strategies

### 1. Convert peripheral contributors to regular contributors

Your network has a large periphery of occasional contributors that could become more engaged.

**Recommended Actions:**

- Create 'Second Contribution' incentives like badges or recognition
- Actively reach out to one-time contributors with specific follow-up tasks
- Track and reduce the 'time to first feedback' for newcomer contributions
- Set up automated first-issue suggestions for new contributors based on their initial work

**Rationale:** Network has 5 peripheral nodes vs. 0 core nodes; research shows contributors who make a second contribution within 48 hours are much more likely to become regulars

## Knowledge Sharing

### 1. Reduce bus factor risk

Your project shows high dependence on a small number of key contributors, creating risk if these individuals become unavailable.

**Recommended Actions:**

- Create CODEOWNERS files that require multiple reviewers
- Implement pair programming or shadowing for critical subsystems
- Document architectural decisions and implicit knowledge
- Create onboarding paths to critical subsystems with graduated responsibility

**Rationale:** Network centrality shows top 3 contributors are involved in 65.9% of all collaborations

## Decision Making

### 1. Improve cross-community decision coordination

Your project has communities with limited external connections, which can lead to misaligned decisions and duplicated work.

**Recommended Actions:**

- Create a cross-community architecture council
- Implement project-wide RFC processes for significant changes
- Establish regular cross-community sync meetings
- Create shared roadmaps with explicit cross-community dependencies

**Rationale:** Network analysis identified 26 communities with limited bridges to other groups
