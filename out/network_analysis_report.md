    ## Community Structure
    
    The repository collaboration network contains 5 distinct communities,
    with modularity of 0.327, indicating
    moderate 
    community structure.
    
    ## Rich Club Analysis
    
    No significant rich club effect detected, suggesting an egalitarian contribution structure.
    
    ## Structural Roles
    
    The network contains diverse structural roles:
    - **Hubs**: 3 contributors
    - **Bridges**: 0 contributors  
    - **Peripheral**: 5 contributors
    - **Core**: 0 contributors
    - **Regular**: 18 contributors
    
    ## Recommendations for Project Governance
    
    1. **Community Integration**:
       - Create cross-community initiatives led by bridge nodes (web-flow, lucyleeow)
       - Establish regular knowledge-sharing sessions between community representatives
    
    2. **Contributor Development**:
       - Implement mentorship program pairing peripheral nodes with bridge nodes
       - Create documentation guidelines led by hub contributors (web-flow, scikit-learn-bot)
    
    3. **Sustainability Planning**:
       - Identify potential successors for core contributors
       - Distribute critical knowledge across multiple contributors
    
    4. **Community Growth**:
       - Target recruitment to strengthen smaller communities
       - Create "welcome teams" with representatives from each community
    
    5. **Collaboration Enhancement**:
       - Implement rotation system for cross-community review
       - Establish formal knowledge transfer protocols
    
    ## Temporal Analysis
    
    The network has shown growth 
    in active contributors over the analyzed period.
    
    Community structure has strengthened
