# Project Governance Recommendations

Based on comprehensive network analysis of a **medium** project with **moderately centralized** contributor structure and **weak community structure**, the following governance recommendations are provided:

## Recommended Governance Model

### Meritocratic

Decision-making authority is earned through consistent quality contributions.

## Governance Structure Implementation

### Decision-Making Process

- Tiered voting rights based on contribution history
- Core team approval required for architectural changes
- Open discussion period followed by maintainer decision
- Path for non-maintainers to propose significant changes

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Core Project Roles

| Role | Responsibilities | Selection Process |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| Core Team | Architecture decisions, roadmap planning | Meritocracy-based promotion |
| Maintainer | Subsystem ownership, code review | Appointed by Core Team |
| Regular Contributor | Feature development, bug fixes | Self-selected |
| Community Manager | Outreach, community health | Appointed or elected |

### Communication Structure

#### Recommended Communication Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Team chat | Daily coordination | Ongoing |
| Maintainer meeting | Strategic planning | Biweekly |
| Community call | Updates, demos | Monthly |
| Mailing list | Major announcements | As needed |

### Conflict Resolution Process

1. **Direct discussion**: Involved parties attempt to resolve directly
2. **Maintainer mediation**: Area maintainer facilitates resolution
3. **Community discussion**: Time-boxed public discussion
4. **Core team vote**: Final resolution if needed

### Contribution Workflow

#### Recommended Process

1. **Issue creation** - Document the problem/feature
2. **Discussion** - Gather feedback on approach
3. **Implementation** - Create the change with tests
4. **Review** - Peer review and approval
5. **Integration** - Merge and release planning

#### Review Requirements

- At least two approvals including one from component maintainer
- Architectural council review for cross-cutting concerns
